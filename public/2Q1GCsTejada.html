                <p style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px">Lebron James' athleticism sets up the groundwork for all of his moves and skills on the court. His towering height of 6'9 and his ability to jump over 40 inches in the air gives him a huge advantage over his opponents, making him an unstoppable force of nature.</p>
